When you search for cars, always follow these rules to individuate the best cars for the user:

GENERAL SELECTION RULES:
- Suggest EXACTLY 3 real cars available on the User market
- Identify the user's primary focus (space, economy, performance, etc.).
- Use this focus ONLY when adding new cars.
- New cars MUST match the user's market and language.
- For each new car, provide 7–10 properties relevant to the primary focus but not price, year, make, model, type, market_availability cause they already exist in the response schema.
