# CarGPT Architecture Documentation 🏗️

This document describes the architectural structure of the CarGPT backend, which follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** and **Service Layer** patterns.

## 📐 Overview

CarGPT has transitioned to a powerful **Monorepo** architecture to separate concerns between the modern **React Frontend** and the **Express Backend**.

## 🔄 Data Flow

1.  **Request**: The browser sends an HTTP request (e.g., `POST /api/find-cars`) with an `Accept-Language` header.
2.  **Entry Point**: `server.ts` receives the request and passes it to the `api.ts` router.
3.  **Router**: `api.ts` identifies the correct controller method.
4.  **Controller**:
    *   Extracts parameters from `req.body` and headers.
    *   Calls `promptService` to load the appropriate template.
    *   Calls `ollamaService` to interact with the LLM.
    *   Parses the LLM response using `ollamaService.parseJsonResponse`.
    *   Saves the interaction to `conversationService`.
    *   **Observability**: All model interactions are traced using **Langfuse**.
5.  **Response**: The controller sends the processed JSON back to the client.

## 🔍 Observability (Langfuse)

CarGPT uses **Langfuse** for end-to-end tracing of AI operations:
- **Traces**: Created at the controller level (e.g., `search_cars_API`, `ask_about_car_API`) to track the entire user request.
- **Spans**: Track specific operations like **Google Image Search** or **Ollama Generations**.
- **Generations**: specifically track the input/output and token usage of the LLM.
- **Scores**: (Future) Can be used to track user feedback (refinements).

## 💻 Frontend Architecture (apps/web)

The frontend is a modern **Single Page Application (SPA)**:
- **React 19**: Modern UI library with Functional Components and Hooks.
- **Chakra UI v2**: Simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast build tool and dev server.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety across components and API interactions.

### Component Logic
- **`App.tsx`**: Manages the global state (cars, history, views).
- **`InitialForm.tsx`**: Handles requirements input.
- **`ResultsContainer.tsx`**: Orchestrates the display of findings, Q&A, and comparisons.
- **`ComparisonTable.tsx`**: Renders dynamic feature comparisons.

---

## ⚙️ Backend Architecture (apps/server)

The backend is built with **TypeScript** and follows the **MVC** and **Service Layer** patterns:
- **`ollamaService`**: Handles LLM communication and executes **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** tasks to verify that search results correctly match the requested car models.
- **`aiService`**: Orchestrates the search flow, combining LLM analysis with Google Image search and vision-based filtering.
- **`promptService`**: Manages Markdown-based prompt templates. It supports a **modular architecture** where reusable components (like `search-rules.md` and `car-response-schema.md`) are injected into specific task templates (`find-cars.md`, `refine-cars.md`) to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## ⚡ Execution Mode

To optimize performance, especially when using smaller, local LLMs, the application supports two execution modes for concurrent operations:

1.  **Parallel Execution (Default)**: Multiple promises (e.g., API calls to the LLM for enriching car data) are executed in parallel using `Promise.all`. This is generally faster when the underlying services can handle concurrent requests efficiently.

2.  **Sequential Execution**: By setting the `SEQUENTIAL_PROMISE_EXECUTION=true` environment variable, all concurrent promise-based operations will be executed sequentially. This mode can be more precise and even faster with smaller local LLMs, as it prevents resource contention and allows the model to process one request at a time with full focus. This is particularly useful for debugging and for environments with limited resources.

### 🛡️ Resilience and Retries

To improve robustness against transient failures (network issues, LLM timeouts, or resource contention), the **`aiService`** implements a **retry system** for its core processing steps:

- **Steps covered**: Intent extraction, car suggestions, car elaboration, translation, and image enrichment.
- **Mechanism**: Each step is wrapped in a `withRetry` helper that attempts the operation multiple times before failing.
- **Configuration**: The number of retries is controlled by the `AI_RETRY_COUNT` environment variable (default: 2 retries, total 3 attempts).
- **Graceful Failure**: If all attempts fail, the error is logged and propagated to the user.

## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from HTTP handling.
-   **Lean Entry Point**: `server.ts` is approximately 100 lines and focuses solely on initialization.
-   **TypeScript-First**: Ensuring type safety across all controllers, services, and models.
-   **JSDoc Documentation**: All exported functions and methods are documented for better IDE support and developer experience.
-   **Centralized Config**: No hardcoded secrets or environment dependencies outside `src/config/`.
-   **Native Localization**: Built-in support for browser language detection and market restriction across all layers.
